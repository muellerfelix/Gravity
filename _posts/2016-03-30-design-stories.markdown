# Intro
As minimalism has a lot of different aspects, i want to start with what i mean when speaking of minimalism.
For me, it means just owning things that you really, essentially need for living a *happy* life as a person.

## The reasons I want to go minimalistic.
There are several reasons for me to live a more minimalistic live.

The thought of reducing things and by that gaining more time for living life came to my mind after backpacking south-east Asia for 5 weeks in 2015. I traveled with a 60 litres backpack and when i came back home, I found myself overstrained with all the clothes in the wardrobe. Although I am not a fashion collector, clothing takes up a lot of space and time in my life.

Thinking about the amount of clothing I own was the impulse to thinking about stuff I own in general.
